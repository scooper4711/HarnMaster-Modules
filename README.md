# HarnMaster-Modules
This is a list of the many modules I use for my HârnMaster game. 
For each module, I list the name, if it's mostly a help during prep time 
(:book:) or game-time (:game_die:) and my comments on why

# Must-have Modules
These are the modules which I feel are universal in applicability 
and if you are running HârnMaster, it's my opinion you should have 
these installed. Many of these should be part of base foundry.
